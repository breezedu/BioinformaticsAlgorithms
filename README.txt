This repository includes some of the Bioinformatics Algorithms I wrote with Java.

Have to say most of them are naive codes, :) 
Hope I could write professional codes after system trainning.

Just updated the GlobalSequenceAlignmentProblem.java and LocalAlignmentProblem, the results are beautiful :)
