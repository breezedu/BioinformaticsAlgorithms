This repository includes some of the Bioinformatics Algorithms I wrote with Java.

These programs include: Greedy algorithms for motifs search; DNA/RNA to Peptides encoding; 
Directed Acyclic Graph path; Global Alignment, Local Sequence Alignment, etc. 

Some of the datasets used in the programs could be found in the TXT sub repository;
